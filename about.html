                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I am a biomedical engineer with experience measuring, acquiring and processing physiological human signals as well as controlling environmental variables in hospitals and clinical laboratories. I have a good understanding of a wide range of medical devices, electronics principles and medical concept which allow me to liaise between the clinical personnel and engineers making me an effective member in cross-functional teams. On top of my technical background, I have a general understanding of ICT management and digital transformation at a corporate level with emphasis on innovation and marketing due to my recent studies in technology management.

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I did my bachelor degree in biomedical engineering at the Metropolitan Institute of Technology in Medellín, Colombia. During my undergrad, I dictated two courses: electromagnetic physics and bioinstrumentation. At that time, I discovered I had a huge passion and an innate talent for teaching. Also, I developed a wide variety of projects in different courses like a myoelectric controlled prosthesis (bio instrumentation), a wheelchair tongue-based control for quadriplegia (rehabilitation engineering), an ECG software simulation (Sensors), a neonatal incubator simulator (medical device design), etc. During my last year, I made part of Gi2B to develop a research project sponsored by COLCIENCIAS, whose aim was to design and create a diagnostic software for the detection of swallowing disorders. </p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I have worked as a field service engineer in a company where my functions were the design, manufacturing and installations of telemetric sensors systems in hospitals and clinical laboratories. Here, I used my skills in open-source hardware (Arduino), PCB design and electronics. Additionally, I had to be in contact with the engineer teams of every hospital in the metropolitan area, which helped me out a lot to develop my personal relationships and communication skills.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I am working for a non profit cause, with a cross functional team of talent professionals, to develop a low-cost prototype of a mechanical ventilation system due to the current pandemic situation caused by Covid-19.</p>
