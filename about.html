                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I am a biomedical engineer with experience measuring, acquiring and processing physiological human signals as well as controlling environmental variables in hospitals and clinical laboratories. I have a good understanding of a wide range of medical devices, electronics principles and medical concept which allow me to liaise between the clinical personnel and engineers making me an effective member in cross-functional teams. On top of my technical background, I have a general understanding of ICT management and digital transformation at a corporate level with emphasis on innovation and marketing due to my recent studies in technology management.

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>The robotic prosthesis was the reason why I decided to study biomedical engineering. When I was younger I always found a huge interestÂ in how humans have replaced body parts for artificial limbs or artificial organs, and how those have improved our physical capabilities as long technology is advancing.
                         Despite that now my focus line is on other topics, I could not resist making my first myoelectric prosthetic hand using 3D printing, Arduino and sEMG.</p>
