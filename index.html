                    <h3>Why I am doing this?</h3>
                    <p>I have the pleasure to make part of a non-profit project called LungLife, whose main objective is to design and build a low-cost mechanical ventilation prototype which will be donated to public institutions in both Colombia and Mexico. LungLife team includes a wide range of multidisciplinary professionals, since physicians, anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists and engineers. As a Biomedical Engineer, one of my main function is to liaise as a bridge between the clinical and the technical staff. 
                        More info <a href="https://lunglifeorg.com/#home"target="_blank">here</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>About the program</h3>
                    <p>The program simulates a volume control ventilation system. Here, our variable to control is the airflow or volume and our dependent variable is the pressure. 
                        The program request a specific set of input data as a real ventilator does (i.e. tidal volume, rpm, PEEP, I:E ratio, FiO2, Trigger, etc.). The main goal with this simulation is to understand how the three variables (flow, volume and pressure) are displayed on the user interface screen, as a valuable source of information for the experimented clinical staff.</p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title 1</h3> -->
                    <p>One of my favourite branches of biomedical engineering is bio-instrumentation. The acquisition and processing of digital signals were part of my work during my researching experience at the Metropolitan Institute of Technology in Colombia. 
                        Using <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/" target="_blank">Powerlab</a> data acquisition hardware, my team and I acquired surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals from different sets of muscles involved in the swallowing in more than 700 healthy patients. Throughout the project, we have set a series of goals including the building of a database of sEMG signals both healthy patients and those with stroke, Parkinson disease, and others, which have a high swallowing disorders incidence;
                         and the use of a wide range of feature extraction to improve and automate burst detection using classifiers. More info about the team and our publications <a href="publications.html">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>3D printing and Arduino</h3>
                    <p>The robotic prosthesis was the reason why I decided to study biomedical engineering. When I was younger I always found a huge interest in how humans have replaced body parts for artificial limbs or artificial organs, and how those have improved our physical capabilities as long technology is advancing.
                         Despite that now my focus line is on other topics, I could not resist making my first myoelectric prosthetic hand using 3D printing, Arduino and sEMG.</p>
                    <h3>Why I did this?</h3>
                    <p>During my last year at university, I dictated a short course about sEMG and its applications. Due I wanted to do my course half theoric and half practical, I decided to make this printed hand and connect it with the Myo armband, a commercial sEMG bracelet.</p>
