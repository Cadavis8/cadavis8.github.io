                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I am a <b class="highlight"> Biomedical Engineer </b> with experience measuring, acquiring and processing physiological human signals as well as controlling environmental variables in hospitals and clinical laboratories. 
                        I have a good understanding of a wide range of <b class="highlight"> medical devices </b>, electronics principles and medical concept which allow me to liaise between the clinical personnel and engineers making me an effective member in cross-functional teams. 
                        On top of my technical background, I have a general understanding of ICT management and digital transformation at a corporate level with emphasis on innovation and marketing due to my recent studies in <b class="highlight"> Technology Management</b>.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>A bit about me is that I enjoy learning the working principle of everything, the reason why I like to read about physics and science.  In my free time, I like to write code, build electronics projects and print my own designs on my 3D printer. I like zombie video games, swimming and cooking.</p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I did my bachelor degree in <b class="highlight"> Biomedical Engineering </b> at the Metropolitan Institute of Technology in Medellín, Colombia. 
                        During my undergraduate study, I had the awesome opportunity to teach two courses: Electromagnetic Physics and Bioinstrumentation. At that time, I discovered I had a huge passion and an innate talent for teaching.</p> <br>
                    <p>Also, I developed a wide variety of projects for different subjects like a myoelectric controlled prosthesis (Bioinstrumentation), an electric wheelchair tongue-based control for quadriplegia patients (Rehabilitation Engineering), an ECG wave simulator software (Sensors), a neonatal incubator simulator device (Medical Device Ddesign), etc.</p>
                    <p>During my last undergraduate year, I was part of Gi2B, developing a research project sponsored by COLCIENCIAS whose aim was to design and create a diagnostic software for detection of swallowing disorders using sEMG and Machine Learning. </p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>Right now I am working in the <b class="highlight"> Medical Device </b> industry as a <b class="highlight"> Biomedical Engineer </b>, performing preventive/scheduled maintenance on medical devices, and installing, calibrating, repairing and inspecting medical equipment in medical centers around New Zealand.</p> <br>
                    <p>Previosly, I worked as a <b class="highlight"> Field Service Engineer </b> for a company where my key responsabilities were to design, build and install telemetric sensors systems for hospitals and clinical laboratories. Consequently, I had to be in contact with the engineer teams of different hospitals around the metropolitan area, which helped me out to develop personal relationships and communication skills.</p> <br>
                    <p>During the Pandemic situation caused by Covid-19 in 2020, I collaborated with a small non profit organization, where a cross functional team of talent professionals were developing a low-cost prototype of mechanical ventilation system.</p>
