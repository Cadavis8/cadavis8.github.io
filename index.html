                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I am a <b class="highlight">Biomedical Engineer</b> with experience measuring, acquiring and processing human physiological signals, controlling environmental variables in hospital sensors and installing, calibrating, repairing and inspecting medical equipment. I have a good understanding of a wide range of medical devices, electronics principles and medical concepts, which allow me to liaise between the clinical personnel and engineers making me an influential member of cross-functional teams. On top of my technical background, I have a general understanding of ICT management and digital transformation at a corporate level with an emphasis on innovation and marketing due to my recent studies in <b class="highlight"> Technology Management</b>.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>A bit about me is that I enjoy learning the working principle of everything, which is why I like to read about physics and science. I enjoy writing code to build electronics projects and printing my designs on my 3D printer in my free time.</p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I did my <b class="highlight">bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering</b> at the Metropolitan Institute of Technology in Medellín, Colombia. During my undergraduate study, I had the incredible opportunity to teach two courses: Electromagnetic Physics and Bioinstrumentation. At that time, I discovered I had a huge passion and an innate talent for teaching.</p> <br>
                    <p>Also, I developed a wide variety of projects for different subjects like a myoelectric controlled prosthesis (Bioinstrumentation paper), an electric wheelchair tongue-based control for quadriplegia patients (Rehabilitation Engineering paper), an ECG wave simulator software (Sensors paper), a neonatal incubator simulator device (Medical Device Design paper), etc.</p>
                    <p>During my last undergraduate year, I was part of <b class="highlight">Gi2B</b>, developing a research project sponsored by <b class="highlight">COLCIENCIAS</b> whose aim was to design and create diagnostic software for the detection of swallowing disorders using sEMG and Machine Learning. </p>

                    <!-- <h3>Title</h3> -->
                    <p>I am currently working in the Medical Device industry as a <b class="highlight">Biomedical Engineer</b>, performing preventive/scheduled maintenance on medical devices and installing, calibrating, repairing and inspecting medical equipment in medical centres around New Zealand.</p> <br>
                    <p>Previously, I worked as a Field Service Engineer for a company where my key responsibilities were designing, building and installing telemetric sensor systems for hospitals and clinical laboratories. Consequently, I had to contact the engineer teams of different hospitals around the metropolitan area, which helped me develop personal relationships and communication skills.</p> <br>
                    <p>During the pandemic caused by Covid-19 in 2020, I collaborated with a small non-profit organization, where a cross-functional team of talented professionals aimed to develop a low-cost prototype of a mechanical ventilation system.</p>
